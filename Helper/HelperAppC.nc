/**
 * Application file for the BlinkToRadio application.  A counter is
 * incremented and a radio message is sent whenever a timer fires.
 * Whenever a radio message is received, the three least significant
 * bits of the counter in the message payload are displayed on the
 * LEDs.  Program two motes with this application.  As long as they
 * are both within range of each other, the LEDs on both will keep
 * changing.  If the LEDs on one (or both) of the nodes stops changing
 * and hold steady, then that node is no longer receiving any messages
 * from the other node.
